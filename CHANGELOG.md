## 0.5.0 (February 23, 2022)

KNOWN ISSUES: _See the linked GitHub issues for details on any workarounds_

* Creating a task with the same name as a deleted task, where the deleted task includes a `condition "schedule"`, can leave CTS in a bad state [[GH-715](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-terraform-sync/issues/715)]
* Creating a task with multiple module inputs using JSON requires specific JSON format. [[GH-714](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-terraform-sync/issues/714)]
* **(Enterprise Only)** Regression with Terraform Cloud driver's `required_providers` configuration which leads the driver to potentially attempt to retrieve an incorrect provider source and version [[GH-728](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-terraform-sync/issues/728)]

BREAKING CHANGES:
* Stop monitoring and including non-passing service instances in `terraform.tfvars` by default. CTS should only monitor passing service instances unless configured otherwise. [[GH-430](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-terraform-sync/issues/430)]
* Removed `driver.terraform.working_dir` configuration option that was deprecated in v0.3.0. Use top-level `working_dir` to configure parent directory for all tasks or `task.working_dir` to configure per task. [[GH-548](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-terraform-sync/pull/548)]
* Require that `condition "catalog-services"` block's `regexp` field be configured instead of relying on previous default behavior. [[GH-574](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-terraform-sync/pull/574)]
* Change default value of `source_includes_var` field from false to true for all types of `condition` blocks. [[GH-578](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-terraform-sync/pull/578)]

* Support for `-auto-approve` option to skip interactive approval prompts in the CLI. [[GH-576](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-terraform-sync/pull/576)]

IMPROVEMENTS:
* Tasks will now trigger only after the `min` time of the `buffer_period` configuration has transpired. Previously tasks would trigger immediately, once, before honoring the minimum buffer period time. [[GH-642](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-terraform-sync/pull/642)]
* Support configuring a task's `condition "services"` and `source_input "services"` blocks with query parameters: `datacenter`, `namespace`, `filter`, and `cts_user_defined_meta`. [[GH-357](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-terraform-sync/issues/357)]
* Support new `names` field for configuring a task's `condition "services"` and `source_input "services"` blocks as an optional alternative to `regexp` to list monitored services by name. [[GH-561](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-terraform-sync/issues/561)]

DEPRECATIONS:
* **(Enterprise Only)** Deprecate `workspace_prefix` for the Terraform Cloud driver that adds unexpected `-` character added between the prefix and task name. Use the new `workspaces.prefix` option instead. [[GH-442](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-terraform-sync/issues/442)]
  * If the `workspace_prefix` option is in use by CTS v0.3.x or v0.4.x for the Terraform Cloud driver, visit [GH-442](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-terraform-sync/issues/442) for upgrade guidelines.
* Deprecate `port` CLI option. Use `http-addr` option instead. [[GH-617](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-terraform-sync/pull/617)]
* Deprecate `services` field in task configuration. Use `condition "services"` or `source_input "services"` instead. [[GH-669](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-terraform-sync/issues/669)]
* Deprecate `service` block in configuration. To replace usage, first upgrade the associated task config `services` field to a `condition "services"` or `source_input "services"`. Then move the `service` block fields into the new `condition` or `source_input` block. [[GH-670](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-terraform-sync/issues/670)]
* Deprecate `source` field in task configuration. Rename `source` to `module` in configuration. [[GH-566](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-terraform-sync/issues/566)]

* Deprecate `source_includes_var` field in task configuration's `condition` block. Rename `source_includes_var` to `use_as_module_input` in configuration. [[GH-568](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-terraform-sync/issues/568)]
* Deprecate non-status, config-related information from the Task Status API's response payload. Use the Get Task API instead to retrieve the deprecated information. [[GH-569](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-terraform-sync/issues/569)]

BUG FIXES:
* Fix CLI client enable task command timing out when buffer period is enabled [[GH-516](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-terraform-sync/issues/516)]
* Fix Services condition when configured with regex and Catalog Services condition to use cached indexes for Consul API blocking queries. [[GH-529](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-terraform-sync/issues/529)]

* Fix 0.4.0 docker image to use static binaries. [[GH-474](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-terraform-sync/issues/474)]

## 0.4.0 (October 13, 2021)
KNOWN ISSUES:
* The formatting of the Terraform Plan outputted in the terminal by the Enable CLI and Inspect Mode is difficult to read when used with the TFC driver for certain Terraform versions. See issue for workaround. [[GH-425](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-terraform-sync/issues/425)]

* Add support for new Consul KV source input block which can be used in conjunction with the scheduled task trigger `task.source_input "consul-kv"`. This allows for Consul key-values to be used as input to the Terraform Module. [[GH-389](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-terraform-sync/issues/389)]

IMPROVEMENTS:
